 # Oak Compact Joystick

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
The Oak Compact Joystick is a medium sized proportional joystick that can be used for adaptive gaming. It has range of motion of approximately ±25° and requires 525 grams-force to fully deflect. This joystick has a cable with a 3.5 mm TRRS audio plug (i.e., headphone jack). It is compatible Microsoft Xbox Adaptive controller as well as the [Forest Joystick Mouse Hub](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Forest-Joystick-Mouse-Hub) and the [Enabled Controller](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/enabled-controller/).

The Oak Compact Joystick can be used directly as a left or right thumbstick for the Microsoft Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC) using the X1 or X2 analog input ports. It can also be used with the [Forest Joystick Mouse Hub](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Forest-Joystick-Mouse-Hub) as a USB Gamepad or USB Mouse.

The Oak Compact Joystick has a set of easily swappable, modular toppers that can be added to make the joystick easier or more comfortable to use.

The Oak Compact Joystick is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

The current version of the Oak Compact Joystick (v1.0) has been built and user tested.

## OpenAT Joysticks
This design is part of the [OpenAT Joystick Project](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Joysticks), a collection of open source designs for digital access and adapted gaming.  

## How to Obtain an Oak Compact Joystick
There are several options for obtaining the device.

### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the Oak Compact Joystick are contained within this repository.

### 2. Request a build of this device

If you would like to obtain an Oak Compact Joystick, you may submit a build request through the [MMC Library Listing](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/s/product/oak-compact-joystick/01tJR00000092x3YAA). The requestor is responsible for the cost of materials and any shipping.

A limited number of these devices may be available at no-cost to people with disabilities that reside within Canada as part of the [Accesible Technology Program Grant](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/accessible-technology-program/en). If you think this applies to you, please send an email to info@makersmakingchange.com.

### 3. How to build this device for someone else
If you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the device for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Maker Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section.

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Makers Checklist

The Makers Checklist in the [Maker Guide](/Documentation/Oak_Joystick_Maker_Guide.pdf) contains a list of tasks to complete to build the device.

### 2. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Oak Joystick Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Oak_Joystick_BOM.csv) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Oak Compact Joystick.

### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components needed for the Oak Compact Joystick. Make sure to ask the user if they would like any of the optional prints such as toppers or mount adapters. Refer to the [OpenAT Joystick Setup Guide](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Joysticks/Resources/OpenAT_Joystick_Setup_Guide.pdf) for detailed mounting options.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 4. Assemble the Oak Compact Joystick

Reference the [Maker Guide](/Documentation/Oak_Joystick_Maker_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
