 # Oak Compact Joystick

<!--- 
SUMMARY
A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.
 --->
The Oak Compact Joystick is a medium sized proportional joystick that can be used for adaptive gaming. It has range of motion of approximately ±25° and requires 525 grams-force to fully deflect. This joystick has a cable with a 3.5 mm TRRS audio plug (i.e., headphone jack). It is compatible with the X1 or X2 analog input ports on the Microsoft Xbox Adaptive controller as well as the [Forest Joystick Mouse Hub](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Forest-Joystick-Mouse-Hub) and the [Enabled Controller](https://makersmakingchange.com/project/enabled-controller/).

## OpenAT Joysticks
This design is part of the [OpenAT Joystick project](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Joysticks), a collection of open source designs for digital access and adapted gaming.  

## How to Obtain an Oak Compact Joystick
There are several options for obtaining the device.

### 1. Do it Yourself (DIY) or Do it Together (DIT)

This is an open-source assistive technology, so anyone is free to build it. All of the files and instructions required to build the Oak Compact Joystick are contained within this repository.

### 2. Request a build of this device


A limited number of these devices may be available at no-cost to people with disabilities that reside within Canada. If you think this applies to you, please send an email to info@makersmakingchange.com.

Once the device is finalized and published in the Makers Making Change library, it will also be possible to submit a build request to have a volunteer maker build the device. As the requestor, you are responsible for reimbursing the maker for the cost of materials and any shipping.

### 3. How to build this device for someone else
Once the device is finalized and published in the Makers Making Change library, there is a plan to hold a number of build events in Canada. If you'd like to participate, send an email to info@makersmakingchange.com.

Once added to the library, if you have the skills and equipment to build this device, and would like to donate your time to create the device for someone who needs it, visit the [MMC Makers Wanted](https://makersmakingchange.com/maker-wanted/) section to fulfill build requests.

## Getting Started

### 1. Read the Makers Checklist

The Makers Checklist in the [Maker Guide](/Documentation/Oak_Joystick_Maker_Guide.pdf) contains a list of tasks to complete to build the device.

### 2. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Oak Joystick Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Oak_Joystick_BOM.csv) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Oak Compact Joystick.


### 3. Print the 3D Printable components

Print the components needed for the Oak Compact Joystick. Make sure to ask the user if they would like any of the optional prints such as toppers or mount adapters. Refer to the [OpenAT Joystick Setup Guide](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/OpenAT-Joysticks/Resources/OpenAT_Joystick_Setup_Guide.pdf) for detailed mounting options.

All of the files and individual print files can be in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/) folder.

### 4. Assemble the Oak Compact Joystick

Reference the [Maker Guide](/Documentation/Oak_Joystick_Maker_Guide.pdf) for the tools and steps required to build each portion.
