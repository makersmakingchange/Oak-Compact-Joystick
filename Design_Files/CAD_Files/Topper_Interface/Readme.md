This folder contains the CAD Design files for the Oak Joystick Topper Interface.

The Topper_Interface is the portion that is built in to the Topper. It has an internal thread and can be used to create a custom topper.

The Topper_Collet is a collet that fits between the cylindrical portion of the Oak Joystick and the Topper_Nut.

The Topper_Nut is tightened into the topper. It has an external thread and a hexagonal portion to make it easier to grip / tighten.
